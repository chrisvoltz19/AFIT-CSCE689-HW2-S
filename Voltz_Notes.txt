Questions:
1) What code do we need to add to run properly?
2) Server needs to pass whitelist as well correct?
3) Can we assume there is enough memory to put whole file into string or do we need to do a temp file approach?
4) login info stored in: login.txt   (?)
5) what are we supposed to be putting in for code in hashArgon2 

1a?) do we need to make whitelist? is a .txt acceptable? do you care where we store it? (question valid for all files)



Tasks: 
- IP Whitelist
	- read in value and compare until read all or match
	- if valid continue, else exit  (no error messgage?)
- Username
	- read list of usernames and compare, invalid quit immediately
	- 2 attempts for password if valid username
- Password
	- use Argon2 (32 bytes)
	- add unique 16-byte salt for each user
	- pepper (optional)
	- change password by entering new password twice 
- adduser_main.cpp
	- don't touch (needs to be able to work with unmodified)
- events: log below events to server.log with time/date (to the second)
	- server statup
	- new connections on whitelist (IP)
	- new connections not on whitelist (IP)
	- recognized usernames (username and IP)
	- unrecognized usernames (username and IP)
	- users that twice failed to enter password (username, IP)
	- Successful login (username, IP)
	- disconnect(username, IP)

Main files to edit:
- TCPClient.cpp (maybe figure out where whitelist confirmation is)
- TCPServer.cpp (maybe do servers have to be verified against whitelist?)
- PasswdMgr.cpp


Hashing process: 
1) password is set by command line
2) password is hashed, salted, and (optionally) peppered)
3) password is stored in random file
4) user enters password which goes through same process and then is compared to hash

Misc Notes:
- password file format is (each is stored on a newline):
username
password
salt
- if going the tmp file way, use the mv command to rename (with hardcoded string so it is as secure as possible)
- event logger should be in TCPServer.cpp
        - make a variable in the .h to hold time 



read in password 
create own hash with salt of 16 bytes
send password in cleartext (kerberos system more secure for homework question)
